<p>Hi, my name is Ralitsa Batista and I currently study at Helsinki Business College. Enjoy the Meal-PLanner App. I welcome constructive feedbacks and ideas about the App so please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>I have come up with the idea of creating Meal-Planner App as I have gone throught the struggle of wondering how and when could I start introducing solids to my children and what is best to start with. Sometimes getting too much information from different sources can be challenging and confusing. The battle with the weight gain and how to mantain a healthy lifestyle interests me personally.</p>
<p>The application could be suggested also by Maternity clinics and consultations to their clients and patients as well.</p>
